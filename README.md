Bowling Challenge
=================

This project represents the fifth and sixth weekend challenge at Makers Academy coding bootcamp.

The app counts and sums the scores of a bowling game for one player. The logic was written following Uncle Bob's [bowling kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).

## Installation and use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open **index.html** and press **Roll**.


## Screenshots

## Technologies used

* **JavaScript**
* **Jasmine** for testing.
* **JQuery** for the interface.
* **HTML5** and **CSS3** for design.

## Future work

The interface is still not perfect in displaying the knocked down pins and frames. So work in progress to get that fixed.
